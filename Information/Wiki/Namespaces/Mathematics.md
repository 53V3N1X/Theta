##### Classes Tree

> - Mathematics (namespace)
>   - Constants
>   - Arithmetic
>   - Logic

##### Generics

>The mathematics libraries are designed to be easily used with generic types. Each branch
>of mathematics has an interface for providing delegate mappings to classes using generic
>types. The result is a typically faster and easier to use design than using complex
>interfacing (as most C# math libraries currently use).
