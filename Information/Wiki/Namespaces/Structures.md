##### Summary

>The "Seven/Structures" directory contains a collection of generic
>data structure implementations. The goal is to provide a complete 
>library of all known data structure templates that all follow the
>same design and implementation patterns.

##### Runtime Analysis

>These data structure files contain runtime values.<br />
>The runtimes should be located in the "remarks" tag on public members.<br />
>All runtimes are in O-Notation. Here is a brief explanation:<br />
>
>- "O(x)": the member has an upper bound of runtime equation "x"
>- "Omega(x)": the member has a lower bound of runtime equation "x"
>- "Theta(x)": the member has an upper and lower bound of runtime equation "x"
>- "average(x)": the runtime equation "x" to typically expect

##### Sorting Algorithms

>Various data structures may use sorting techniques on the items 
>within them. For specific sorting, see the "Sort" class, which 
>contains various sorting algorithms on arrays. All the data 
>structures include "ToArray" methods, so that you can pull out
>the contents and sort it.
