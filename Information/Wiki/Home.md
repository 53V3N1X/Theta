##### Summary

>The Seven code library aims to be the most advanced general-purpose 
>coding framework to date by considering concepts from all the
>programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.),
>and maintaining quality in-code xml documentation.

>Note: The primary goal of the Seven project is to keep up to date with
>modern theory and design patterns. If this means altering 
>fundamental components in the framework, then so be it. This is just
>a general warning that the code may be dynamic, so developers should
>keep back-ups of the framework while the develop or be prepared to
>update anything that need be updated.
